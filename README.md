Sensor for IOT

IOT sensor to replanish the workstation

Writer of the report: Leander Koenders


### Project overview
The goal of the course was to see if it was possible to connect a sensor to Tulip (a software platform, later in the report it will be highlighted). With this report it would be possible to set up everything within 6-8 hours (plus one day of learning the platform Tulip where the sensor is connected to)


### Objectives
At my company (virtual) there was a need to see if a workstation needed to be refilled or not. We also wanted to see if the positions at the workstation where empty by sensors rather then by a human that was scanning a bucket. And the best way to do this was to have a sensor detecting if there is a bucket there or not. So the sensor measures the distance to the bucket and if the distance is bigger then it means that the bucket is not any more at its place. Then there will be a signal sended out that the workstation needs to be replanished.
